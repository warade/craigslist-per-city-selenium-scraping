# Introduction
Python script to automatically post job ads to craigslist.

# Description
To quote...
> _To build our waitlist. we'd like to automate posting job ads to Craigslist on a frequent basis. In the past, we have posted manually in 2 cities which doesn't scale. Going forward, we would like to have a script that posts automatically. 
> There is a lot of information out there how people automated scraping and posting to Craigslist._

# Requirements
To quote...
> As for desired requirements:
> 1. Generate a list of all the US Craigslist cities (https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites) and how much it costs to post a job ad. All cities have different prices for job posts, some are free. This might require some scraping. 
> 2. Build a script that can automatically post a job post to a set of selected cities and generate a report with all the URLs to the individual job posts.
> 3. Build a simple mechanism to target specific cities for posting. This can be as simple as using a csv file as an input. Reason we need this is that we might adjust our strategy over time._

# Questions
1. What is the process to use the api of bulk posting. Do we want to signup for that process and go through various steps with the Craigslist.
2. Are we targeting free cities of paid cities? 
3. Which categories are we posting in it?
4. How many cities are you going to post a job?
5. It seems possible to build the solution for free cities.
